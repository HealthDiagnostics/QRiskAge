QRiskAge
========

This is the Health Diagnostics QRiskAge implementation

The initial version of this file, to be found at http://svn.clinrisk.co.uk/qrisk2, faithfully implements QRISK2-2012.
We have released this code under the GNU Lesser General Public License to enable others to implement the algorithm faithfully.
However, the nature of the GNU Lesser General Public License is such that we cannot prevent, for example, someone altering the coefficients.
We stress, therefore, that it is the responsibility of the end user to check that the source that they receive produces the same results as the 
original code posted at http://svn.clinrisk.co.uk/qrisk2.
Inaccurate implementations of risk scores can lead to wrong patients being given the wrong treatment.
